## Human-Computer Interaction Project/Lab1

Task: Create a Todo-List

For now Target Audience = General Audience (anyone)

1. List Format for easy viewing

2. Checkbox to indicate when a task is done

	1. Filled in (TBD what's considered as filled in) = task was done

	2. Unfilled (TBD what's considered not filled) = not done


### 2/2/2023: 

List and Title will be in the middle of the screen. Length of the divider/box should be enough to fill in one sentence.

Color of background = white
Color of text = black
Checkbox = square box/button

Each List has a boarder indicating an empty task with faded out words saying:
"Click Here to Start"

Have a button at the bottom center indicating: "create new task"

Each Task is seperate by at least one line of space

**What I need To Review**
1. CSS: 
	- margins and paddings
		-> Properly design the look of the todo-list

2. Bootstrap: Everything

3. HTML:
	- Typing in a textbox


### 2/7/23

I will try implementing a card from the bootstrap website to make a more visually appealing todo list.

#### **What I Have to Edit and Work On**

**"Add Items":** 

Will Change the description area to a few buttons:

1. Add description

2. Add Link (singular link for now)

3. Add Alarm/Date in which the task is due


**To the title of the task:** 

1. Will add a star to the right to signify importance

	a. the user can click on it and it will get filled

		a. filled = important task

		b. unfilled = not important task


2. Add a change of color option to the left of the of the star


**At the bottom:**
- Will add a button "X" which deletes the task


*later*

- Will make a edit button that will bring a pop up window which then allows the user to change the color, time, etc. more conviniently instead of having everything cluttered onto the box

- When the checkbox is ticked, the task is blurred out and put to the bottom of the list

	- The user will still be able to uncheck the task, they just have to scroll down


*later later*

- Have a button at the top allowing the user to check on previous ticked off tasks so that they won't take up space at the bottom

	- User will be allowed to uncheck the task in that window
