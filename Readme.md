Task: Create a Todo-List

For now Target Audience = General Audience (anyone)

1. List Format for easy viewing

2. Checkbox to indicate when a task is done

	1. Filled in (TBD what's considered as filled in) = task was done

	2. Unfilled (TBD what's considered not filled) = not done

2/2/2023: 

List and Title will be in the middle of the screen. Length of the divider/box should be enough to fill in one sentence.

Color of background = white
Color of text = black
Checkbox = square box/button

Each List has a boarder indicating an empty task with faded out words saying:
"Click Here to Start"

Each Task is seperate by at least one line of space

**What I need To Review**
1. CSS: 
	- margins and paddings
		-> Properly design the look of the todo-list

2. Bootstrap: Everything

3. HTML:
	- Typing in a textbox
